Midjourney is an AI bot that uses textual prompts to create unique images. 

The Midjourney Bot uses text prompts to generate images based on its training data, dissecting the prompts into smaller units known as tokens. These prompts can be simple like a single word or emoji, or more complex, featuring multiple text phrases, image URLs, and various parameters.

Should you opt to use an image URL to guide the style and content of the final result, ensure it's positioned at the start of your prompt. This URL can significantly influence the output image.

The main body of your textual prompt should include essential elements such as quantity or collective nouns, the artistic medium, era or style, emotions, colors, and environment. All these components provide specificity, which is a critical aspect of generating a unique and satisfying image with Midjourney. Remember that the Bot doesn't comprehend grammar, sentence structure, or words like humans, so it's always better to specify what you want instead of what you don't. For instance, stating "Three cats" is more specific than just saying "cats," and mentioning an artistic medium such as block print, watercolor, or pixel art can add a distinct style to your image.

Parameters that alter aspects like ratios, model versions, upscalers, and more are added at the end of the prompt. These settings can considerably change how your image is generated.

On the Mid Journey app, you can also generate images in the style of famous artists. Simply copy the artist's name from the Styles tab and include it in your text prompt with the phrase "in the style of."

Here's an example of a full prompt structure: [Image URL] /imagine three cats playing in a jungle, looking happy, in the style of Pablo Picasso, medium: watercolor, color: pastel [Parameters].

In this case, the "/imagine" command is used to initiate the AI art generation in the Mid Journey Discord channel. This detailed prompt, encompassing specific elements, is more likely to yield a satisfying image than a less descriptive one. So, always remember, detail and precision are your best tools when using Midjourney.

Midjourney is an AI bot that uses text-based prompts to generate unique images. The prompts can range from simple to complex, and may include specific words, phrases, image URLs, and parameters.

When composing a prompt, it's important to keep the following key points in mind:

Image URLs: If an image URL is to guide the style and content of the final result, it should be positioned at the start of the prompt. This URL can significantly influence the output image.

Essential Elements: The prompt should include specific elements such as the quantity or collective nouns, the artistic medium, era or style, emotions, colors, and environment. For example, "Three cats in a jungle, medium: watercolor, color: pastel."

Parameters: These are added at the end of the prompt and can alter aspects like ratios, model versions, upscalers, and more, significantly changing the image's output.

Here are examples of good and less effective prompts to use as training data:

Good Prompt: "[Image URL] /imagine a serene cityscape at dusk, buildings bathed in the soft glow of the setting sun, in the style of Vincent Van Gogh, medium: oil painting, color: warm hues [Parameters]."

Less Effective Prompt: "City at sunset."

Remember, the bot doesn't understand grammar or sentence structure in the same way humans do. Therefore, it's better to be explicit and precise in the prompts. Including a variety of detailed prompts in the training data, as well as a few less effective ones, can help the model understand the difference and generate more effective prompts.

Also, prompts that explore different parameters can help the model understand how they can change the final image. For example: "[Image URL] /imagine a serene cityscape at dusk, buildings bathed in the soft glow of the setting sun, in the style of Vincent Van Gogh, medium: oil painting, color: warm hues, ratio: 16:9, model version: 2.0, upscale: true [Parameters]."

AI art has been used to create a wide range of art, from realistic photography to abstract patterned work.
The potential of AI art is only limited by your imagination as the technology continues to develop.
AI is not intended to replace artists, but to provide them with a powerful new tool.
AI art in Mid Journey is created by an algorithm trained on datasets of images.
The algorithm recognizes patterns in the images and generates new images reflecting those patterns.
The results from Mid Journey are impressive and can be indistinguishable from traditional artwork.
When using Mid Journey, you provide a prompt to guide the type of art to be created.
The process of using prompts to guide the creation of AI art is known as prompt craft.

Prompts
A Prompt is a short text phrase that the Midjourney Bot interprets to produce an image. The Midjourney Bot breaks down the words and phrases in a prompt into smaller pieces, called tokens, that can be compared to its training data and then used to generate an image.
A basic prompt can be as simple as a single word, phrase or emoji. More advanced prompts can include one or more image URLs, multiple text phrases, and one or more parameters.
Image URLs can be added to a prompt to influence the style and content of the finished result. Image URLs always go at the front of a prompt.
Parameters change how an image generates. Parameters can change aspect ratios, models, upscalers, and lots more. Parameters go at the end of the prompt.
Prompts can be very simple. Single words (or even an emoji!) will produce an image. Very short prompts will rely heavily on Midjourney’s default style, so a more descriptive prompt is better for a unique look.
The Midjourney Bot does not understand grammar, sentence structure, or words like humans. Word choice also matters. More specific synonyms work better in many circumstances.
It is better to describe what you want instead of what you don’t want. If you ask for a party with “no cake,” your image will probably include a cake.
Anything left unsaid may surprise you. Be as specific or vague as you want, but anything you leave out will be randomized.
Use collective nouns. Plural words leave a lot to chance. Try specific numbers. "Three cats" is more specific than "cats." Collective nouns also work, “flock of birds” instead of "birds.”
Even short single-word prompts will produce beautiful images in Midjourney's default style, but you can create more interesting personalized results by combining concepts like artistic medium, historical periods, location, and more.
One of the best ways to generate a stylish image is by specifying an artistic medium. Examples include block print, folk art, cyanotype, graffiti, paint-by-numbers, risograph, ukiyo-e, pencil sketch, watercolor, pixel art, blacklight painting, and cross stitch.
More precise words and phrases will help create an image with exactly the right look and feel. Examples include life drawing, continuous line, loose gestural, blind contour, value study, and charcoal sketch.
Different eras have distinct visual styles. You can specify a decade to get a cat illustration in the style of that era.
Use emotion words to give characters personality. Examples include determined, happy, sleepy, angry, shy, and embarrassed.
You can specify a color to get a cat in that color. Examples include millennial pink, acid green, desaturated, canary yellow, peach, two-toned, pastel, mauve, ebony, neutral, day glo, and green-tinted.
Different environments can set unique moods. Examples include tundra, salt flat, jungle, desert, mountain, and cloud forest.
Your First AI Art! Prompt Fundamentals
To create AI art, you need to type "/imagine" in the message box in the Mid Journey Discord channel, followed by your chosen prompt.
The algorithm generates your artwork in real time, providing four variations of the image based on your prompt.
You can upscale any of the four images to enhance its detail and resolution.
The "U" command followed by the image number (1-4) is used to select and upscale an image.
The "V" command followed by the image number creates new variations based on a specific image.
The rotating arrows command reruns the entire command, providing four completely new options based on the original prompt.
You can download your images by right-clicking and choosing "Save Image As", or by clicking the "Web" button underneath the image.
The Mid Journey app allows you to bookmark and rate your images.
You can run the same command multiple times to get different results, refining your aesthetic sensibilities as an artist.
The next lesson will cover more advanced features available in Mid Journey.
Stylization With Text Prompts
There are three parts to a prompt in Mid Journey: an image, a text prompt, and parameters.
The Styles tab in the Mid Journey app allows you to create images in the style of famous artists.
To use an artist's style, copy their name from the Styles tab and include it in your text prompt with the phrase "in the style of".
You can also use themes, such as "steampunk" or "cyberpunk", in your text prompts.
The aesthetics.vndrkm website provides a comprehensive list of aesthetics that can be used for inspiration.
The same text prompt can yield different results when run multiple times.
The style of the generated image can reflect the color palette, brush strokes, and overall aesthetic of the chosen artist or theme.
Experimental Text Prompts
Experiment with well-defined imagery concepts, such as wizards, witches, queens, kings, empresses, etc.
Try combining things that don't exist in the real world, such as a man made of money or a fruit made out of robots.
Use the likeness of famous people for fun, but be aware of copyright issues.
Use lyrics from poems or songs as prompts. Be mindful of copyright issues with song lyrics.
Avoid using prompts that may result in text in the generated image, as Mid Journey does not handle text well.
Experiment with prompts based on tarot cards, biblical characters, mythical characters, and astrological signs.
Try combining different themes and aesthetics, such as "biopunk", "cyber noir", "Egyptian punk", "elf punk", "nano punk", and "neon punk".
The only limit with Mid Journey is your imagination. Let your mind run wild and create impossible things.
Composition
Composition is crucial in creating an aesthetic image, and it involves the positioning of different elements within the frame.
You can control the composition in Mid Journey by specifying the type of composition you want in the text prompt.
Examples of composition prompts include "full body view", "ultra-wide shot", "portrait", "macro shot", "headshot", "extreme close-up", and "side view".
Each composition prompt will yield different results. For example, a "full body view" will show the entire body of the subject, while a "macro shot" will focus on a specific detail.
Mid Journey may struggle with certain types of composition, but it generally does well with a variety of prompts.
Experimenting with different composition prompts can help you create more diverse and interesting images.
Lighting
Lighting is a crucial aspect of any artwork and can significantly influence the mood and aesthetic of an image.
You can control the lighting in Mid Journey by specifying the type of lighting you want in the text prompt.
Lighting can be categorized into warm and cold. Warm lighting, like a match flame or candlelight, gives a warm and inviting feel. Cold lighting, like moonlight or fluorescent lamps, gives a colder, harsher feel.
You can also specify the hardness or softness of the lighting. Soft lighting gives a gentle, dreamlike feel, while hard lighting creates a more dramatic contrast between highlights and lowlights.
Specifying the time of day can also affect the lighting. For example, "morning light" can create a warm, soft lighting effect.
You can also specify specific types of lighting, such as "neon cold lighting" or "volumetric lighting".
Experimenting with different lighting effects can help you create more diverse and interesting images.
Image Prompts
You can use images as a basis for inspiration in Mid Journey. You can either find a URL of an image online or upload an image directly from your computer.
When using images from the internet, make sure they are copyright-free or in the public domain. Unsplash.com is a recommended resource for free-to-use images.
To use an image, you need to open the image in a new tab, copy the URL, and paste it into the Mid Journey chat using the "imagine" command.
By default, Mid Journey takes 25% inspiration from the image you use. You can adjust this using parameters.
You can also use multiple images as inspiration by copying both URLs into the prompt and leaving a space between them. This allows you to combine diverse pieces of inspiration to create something unique.
After generating an image, you can upscale it to create a higher-resolution version for your portfolio or art collection.
Images can be used as part of a prompt in Midjourney to influence the composition, style, and colors of the generated image.
To add images to a prompt, type or paste the web address where the image is stored online. The address must end in an extension like .png, .gif, or .jpg.
Image prompts go at the front of a prompt. Prompts must have two images or one image and text to work.
An image URL must be a direct link to an online image. Your file should end in .png, .gif, .webp, .jpg, or .jpeg.
To incorporate an image into your prompt, you need a direct image link that ends with .png, .gif, .webp, .jpg, or .jpeg. If the image is on your computer or phone, you can send it as a message to the Midjourney Bot first to generate a link.
To add an image to a prompt, begin typing /imagine as usual. After the prompt box appears, drag the image file into the prompt box to add the image's URL, or right-click and paste the link within the prompt box.
Upload images in your Direct Messages with the Midjourney Bot to prevent other server users from seeing an image. Image prompts are visible on the Midjourney website unless a user has Stealth Mode.
You can use the image weight parameter --iw to adjust the importance of the image vs. text portion of a prompt. The default value is used when no --iw is specified. Higher --iw values mean the image prompt will have more impact on the finished job.
Different Midjourney Version Models have different image weight ranges. For example, Version 5 and niji 5 have an image weight range of 0–2, while Version 4 does not have an image weight parameter.
For the best results, crop images to the same aspect ratio as your final image.
Blend Mode
Mid Journey has introduced a new blend mode that allows you to merge different images together into novel interpretations. This is similar to using multiple image prompts with the "imagine" command, but it's easier to use as you can directly drag and drop images into your prompt.
The blend mode allows you to upload up to five images. It excels at merging two diverse styles into one.
To use the blend mode, you type in "/blend" in the Mid Journey chat, which opens a new interface where you can drag and drop your images.
You can use images created on Mid Journey or other images, such as photography from websites like Unsplash.
The blend mode can be slow sometimes, depending on the size of your images. It will automatically upload your images, blend them together, return an output image, and then delete all the images you uploaded.
If you're blending images with different aspect ratios, you may end up with borders around your work. To avoid this, you can use images that are 1:1.
You can use the multiple image mode by typing "/blend", pressing enter, and then pressing tab to add more images. You can add up to four images this way.
The blend mode is a quick and easy way to create unique pieces by combining different styles and images.
The /blend command in Midjourney allows you to upload 2–5 images and merges their concepts and aesthetics into a new image.
This command is optimized for easy use on mobile devices and is similar to using multiple image prompts with /imagine.
/blend works with up to 5 images. For more than 5 images, use image prompts with /imagine.
/blend does not work with text prompts. To use text and image prompts together, use image prompts and text with /imagine.
After typing the /blend command, you will be prompted to upload two photos. You can drag and drop images from your hard drive or add images from your photo library when using a mobile device.
To add more images, select the optional/options field and select image3, image4, or image5.
Blended images have a default 1:1 aspect ratio, but you can use the optional dimensions field to select between a square aspect ratio (1:1), portrait aspect ratio (2:3), or landscape aspect ratio (3:2).
Custom suffixes are added to the end of /blend prompts, like any other /imagine prompt. Aspect ratios specified as part of the /blend command override aspect ratios within a custom suffix.
For the best results, upload images that are the same aspect ratio as your desired result.
Parameters
Parameters are options added to a prompt in Midjourney that change how an image generates. They can alter aspect ratios, switch between Midjourney Model Versions, change the Upscaler used, and more.
Parameters are always added to the end of a prompt and multiple parameters can be added to each prompt.
Basic parameters include aspect ratios, chaos, image weight, negative prompting, quality, repeat, seed, stop, style, stylize, and tile.
Aspect ratios change the aspect ratio of a generation. Chaos changes how varied the results will be. Image weight sets image prompt weight relative to text weight. Negative prompting tries to remove certain elements from the image. Quality determines how much rendering quality time you want to spend. Repeat creates multiple jobs from a single prompt. Seed uses a seed number to create a field of visual noise as a starting point to generate the initial image grids. Stop finishes a job partway through the process. Style switches between versions of the Midjourney Model. Stylize influences how strongly Midjourney's default aesthetic style is applied to jobs. Tile generates images that can be used as repeating tiles to create seamless patterns.
Midjourney routinely releases new model versions to improve efficiency, coherency, and quality. Different models excel at different types of images. The Niji model, for example, is focused on anime-style images. The version parameter allows you to use a different version of the Midjourney algorithm.
Commands
Commands in Midjourney are used to interact with the Midjourney Bot on Discord. They can be used to create images, change default settings, monitor user info, and perform other tasks.
Commands can be used in any Bot Channel, on private Discord servers where the Midjourney Bot has been permitted to operate, or in a direct message with the Midjourney Bot.
Some of the commands include:
/ask: Get an answer to a question.
/blend: Easily blend two images together.
/daily_theme: Toggle notification pings for the #daily-theme channel update.
/docs: Generate a link to topics covered in the user guide.
/describe: Writes four example prompts based on an image you upload.
/faq: Generate a link to popular prompt craft channel FAQs.
/fast: Switch to Fast mode.
/help: Shows helpful basic information and tips about the Midjourney Bot.
/imagine: Generate an image using a prompt.
/info: View information about your account and any queued or running jobs.
/stealth: For Pro Plan Subscribers, switch to Stealth Mode.
/public: For Pro Plan Subscribers, switch to Public Mode.
/subscribe: Generate a personal link for a user's account page.
/settings: View and adjust the Midjourney Bot's settings.
/prefer option: Create or manage a custom option.
/prefer option list: View your current custom options.
/prefer suffix: Specify a suffix to add to the end of every prompt.
/show: Use an images Job ID to regenerate the Job within Discord.
/relax: Switch to Relax mode.
/remix: Toggle Remix mode.
Upscalers
The latest Midjourney Model Version 5 and Niji 5 produce high-resolution 1024 x1024 px image grids without needing an additional step to upscale each image. When using these models, the U1 U2 U3 U4 buttons under each image grid will separate the selected image from the initial image grid for easy saving and downloading.
Earlier Midjourney versions generate a grid of low-resolution image options for each Job. You can use a Midjourney upscaler on any of these images to increase the size and add additional details. Using an upscaler uses your subscription's GPU minutes.
The upscaler for Midjourney Model Version 4 increases image size while smoothing and refining details. Some small elements may change between the initial grid image and the finished upscale.
Remaster is an option for upscaled images made with previous Midjourney Model Versions. Remaster will create a new grid of images using the --v 5.1 parameter blending the composition of the original image and the coherency of the newer -v 5.1 model.
To Remaster very old jobs, use the /show command to refresh that job in Discord.
Versions
Midjourney routinely releases new model versions to improve efficiency, coherency, and quality. The latest model is the default, but other models can be used by adding the --version or --v parameter or by using the /settings command and selecting a model version.
The Midjourney V5.1 model is the newest and most advanced, released on May 4th, 2023. It has a stronger default aesthetic, making it easier to use with simple text prompts. It also has high Coherency, excels at accurately interpreting natural language prompts, produces fewer unwanted artifacts and borders, has increased image sharpness, and supports advanced features like repeating patterns with --tile.
The Midjourney V5 model produces more photographic generations than the default 5.1 model. This model produces images that closely match the prompt but may require longer prompts to achieve your desired aesthetic.
The Midjourney V4 was the default model from Nov 2022–May 2023. This model featured an entirely new codebase and brand-new AI architecture designed by Midjourney and trained on the new Midjourney AI supercluster. Model Version 4 had an increased knowledge of creatures, places, and objects compared to previous models.
The Niji model is a collaboration between Midjourney and Spellbrush tuned to produce anime and illustrative styles with vastly more knowledge of anime, anime styles, and anime aesthetics. It's excellent at dynamic and action shots and character-focused compositions.
To switch models, you can add the version parameter to your prompt or use the /settings command and select your preferred version from the menu.
Version 4
Enhanced Realism: The new algorithm improves the consistency of intricate details like eyes and skin texture. It also understands more real-world objects, creatures, places, and people, allowing for more detailed and accurate renderings.
Complex Prompts: The algorithm can now handle more complex prompts, enabling the creation of scenes with multiple objects and characters interacting with each other.
Advanced Image Prompting: The new functionality allows for more control over the image prompting process.
Chaos Argument: A new argument, "chaos," has been introduced. This allows you to set the amount of variety in the image grids from 0 to 100. A chaos level of 0 results in a consistent output, while a level of 100 provides a more diverse range of images.
REMIX
Remix Mode in Midjourney allows you to change prompts, parameters, model versions, or aspect ratios between variations. It takes the general composition of your starting image and uses it as part of the new job.
Remix Mode is activated with the /prefer remix command or by using the /settings command and toggling the 🎛️ Remix Mode button.
When Remix is enabled, it changes the behavior of the variation buttons (V1, V2, V3, V4) under image grids, allowing you to edit your prompt during each variation.
When Remix is enabled, Variation buttons turn green when used instead of blue.
You can switch Model Versions when using Remix.
When you are done with Remix, use the /settings or /prefer remix command to turn it off.
You can create a standard image variation when Remix is active by not modifying the prompt in the pop-up window.
You can add or remove Parameters while using Remix mode, but you must use valid parameter combinations.
Only parameters that normally influence variations will work while using Remix. These include Aspect Ratio, No, Stop, Tile, and Video.
Changing aspect ratios with Remix will stretch an image. It will not extend the canvas, add missing details, or fix a bad crop.
Remix is an experimental feature that may change or be removed at any time.
Remix Feature: This feature allows you to change the prompt and settings of your artwork, enabling you to update, adapt, and fine-tune your work. You can change the scene, swap between versions of the algorithm, add different parameters, and change the aspect ratio.
How to Use: To use the Remix feature, go to the private message channel with Mid Journey and type in "/settings". Then, on the bottom row at the end, click on the option to turn on Remix mode. You can also directly access this by typing "/remix".
Examples: The lecture provides examples of how the Remix feature can be used to change genders in portraits, alter the surfaces of materials in architectural works, and modify the materials of creatures.
Remixing Old Works: You can remix your old works by going to your profile, clicking on the three dots, copying the job ID, and then pasting it into the box after typing "/show" in the Discord chat.
Creating Animations: The Remix feature can also be used to create animations by morphing from one image to another. A tool called Hugging Face is recommended for this purpose.
Tiling: The Remix feature can be used to create repeating patterns or tiles. If the initial tile doesn't work well, you can make variations to improve the quality of the pattern.
TILE
Tile Feature: This feature allows you to create repeating patterns with your AI art. These patterns can be used on large surfaces like fabrics, wallpapers, and more.
How to Use: To use the Tile feature, you need to type in your prompt in the chat, followed by the parameter "--tile". You can also set the aspect ratio to 1:1, which works best for tiles.
Examples: The lecture provides examples of how the Tile feature can be used to create repeating patterns. These patterns can be used on various products like backpacks, aprons, notebooks, and more.
Using the Tile Feature in Real Life: If you want to use your repeating pattern in real life, you can use a service like Red Bubble. This site allows you to print your design on different merchandise and objects. You can also upload your designs to their marketplace, where other people can purchase them.
Creating Wallpapers: Another site, Spoonflower, allows you to create your own wallpapers with your repeating patterns. This can be used to decorate your home with your own unique designs.
Selling Your Designs: You can also upload your repeating patterns to graphic marketplaces like Creative Market or Etsy, where there is a huge demand for repeating patterns.
NIJI
In this lecture, we're going to discuss the new "Negi" mode in the AI art platform, Mid Journey. This new version of the algorithm is specifically designed for creating anime aesthetics, making it perfect for those who are interested in creating illustrated stories with characters in an anime style.
Here are the key points:
Negi Mode: This new mode in Mid Journey is fine-tuned to produce anime and illustrative styles. The term "Negi" in Japanese can mean either "Rainbow" or "2D", which aligns well with the 2D style of anime aesthetics.
How to Use: To access Negi mode, you can go into the Mid Journey chat, type in "/settings", and turn on the Negi mode. Alternatively, you can append "-Negi" at the end of your prompt to use this version of the algorithm.
Benefits: Negi mode is particularly great at creating dynamic and action shots, as well as character-focused compositions. It has a vast knowledge of anime styles and aesthetics, making it ideal for creating anime-style art.
Examples: The lecture provides examples of the types of art that people have been creating with Negi mode. These include high-quality, illustrative, comic-like outputs, and character designs.
Resources: To understand anime aesthetics in more detail, you can check out the Aesthetics Wiki about Anime Core. You can also use Pinterest to explore different anime styles for inspiration.
In conclusion, Negi mode offers a new way to fine-tune your AI art creations in Mid Journey. It's perfect for those who are interested in anime and illustrative styles, and we can expect to see more algorithms fine-tuned to certain aesthetics in the future.
MULITPROMPTS
In Midjourney, you can use the double colon (::) to separate different concepts in a prompt. This allows the AI to consider each part of the prompt separately.
Adding a number immediately after the double colon assigns relative importance to that part of the prompt. For example, in the prompt "hot::2 dog", the word "hot" is twice as important as "dog".
Model Versions 1, 2, 3 only accept whole numbers as weights, while Model Version 4 can accept decimal places for weights. Non-specified weights default to 1.
Negative weights can be used to remove unwanted elements from the image. However, the sum of all weights must be a positive number.
The --no parameter is equivalent to weighing part of a multi prompt to "-.5". For example, "vibrant tulip fields:: red::-.5" is the same as "vibrant tulip fields --no red". This will make the AI less likely to include the specified element (in this case, the color red) in the image.
Permutation Prompts
Permutation Prompts in Midjourney allow you to generate multiple variations of a prompt with a single command. This is done by including lists of options separated by commas within curly braces {} in your prompt.
You can use Permutation Prompts to create combinations and permutations involving any part of a Midjourney Prompt, including text, image prompts, parameters, or prompt weights.
Permutation prompts are only available while using Fast mode.
The number of jobs you can create with a single Permutation Prompt depends on your subscription level: Basic Subscribers can create a maximum of 4 Jobs, Standard Subscribers can create a maximum of 10 Jobs, and Pro Subscribers can create a maximum of 40 Jobs.
Each Permutation Prompt variation is processed as an individual Job and consumes GPU minutes.
You can use multiple sets of bracketed options in a single prompt, and you can also nest sets of bracketed options inside other sets of brackets within a single prompt.
If you want to include a comma within the curly brackets that does not act as a separator, place a backslash \ directly before it.
Image Size
Image files are essentially instructions for creating an image. Each image is a mosaic of small colored tiles (pixels) that form the picture.
The file size of an image is directly related to the amount of information inside the file. This is usually measured in kilobytes or megabytes.
Image dimensions refer to the number of columns and rows of information (pixels) in an image. Common dimensions include 1024x1024, 720p, and 4K.
Dots Per Inch (DPI) refers to the amount of information in a given length. DPI is not a useful measurement for screens, but it is very important when printing. A standard for a great-looking print is 300 DPI.
The default size of a Midjourney image using the current default Model Version is 1024 x 1024 pixels. Using other aspect ratios will produce images with different dimensions but the same general file size.
Midjourney images can be printed. The quality of the print depends on the DPI. For a quality print, you need 300 pieces of information in every inch. So the default 1024x1024 pixel Midjourney image would produce a good quality 3.4 in x 3.4 in print (1024 / 300 = 3.41).
Essential Parameters
Aspect Ratio: The aspect ratio parameter (--ar) allows you to specify the width and height ratio of the output image. For example, --ar 16:9 will create a landscape image, while --ar 9:16 will create a vertical image. The first number refers to the width and the second number to the height.
No Command: The no command (--no) allows you to exclude certain elements from the generated image. For example, --no trees will generate an image without any trees.
Image Weight: The image weight parameter (--iw) determines how much influence an image has compared to the text part of your prompt. A value of 1 makes the image just as important as the text prompt. The default value is 0.25.
Permutation Prompts: These allow you to quickly generate variations of a prompt with a single /imagine command. By including lists of options separated with commas within curly braces {} in your prompt, you can create multiple versions of a prompt with different combinations of those options.
File Size and DPI: The file size of an image is directly related to the amount of information inside the file. DPI (Dots Per Inch) is a measure of the resolution of an image and is especially important when printing. A standard for a good-looking print is 300 DPI.
Midjourney Images: The default size of a Midjourney image using the current default Model Version is 1024 x 1024 pixels. Using other aspect ratios will produce images with different dimensions but the same general file size.
GPU Minutes: Each job processed by the Midjourney Bot consumes GPU minutes. This is important to keep in mind when using permutation prompts, as each variation is processed as an individual job.
Fast Mode: This mode allows you to quickly generate images, but it has a limit on the number of hours you can use it per month, depending on your subscription level. Once you've used up your fast hours, you can either switch to relax mode, which generates images more slowly, or you can add more fast hours for an additional cost.
Advanced Parameters (Part 1)
Algorithm Versions: Midjourney allows you to use different versions of the algorithm to generate images. The command --v followed by a number (1, 2, or 3) allows you to specify the version. Version 1 is better for textures and macro images, version 2 provides a middle ground, and version 3 (the default) generally produces the best results for most scenarios.
HDX Algorithm: The HDX algorithm (--HD) can add more detail to the generated images but may reduce the consistency of the composition. It takes longer to process images using this algorithm, thus it will cost more.
Upscaling Light: The uplight command (--uplight) allows you to upscale images with less detail, keeping them closer to the original image. This is useful for images with smooth surfaces, like faces, and it's faster than the standard upscaling.
Seeds: Seeds are the random starting noise used at the beginning of image generation. By using the --seed command followed by a four-digit number, you can control how similar or different the variations within the grid are. The --sameseed command followed by a four-digit number ensures consistency within the grid, making all generated images very similar.
These advanced features give you more control over the image generation process, allowing you to specify the algorithm version, detail level, upscaling method, and seed for randomness. This can help you achieve more specific results based on your creative needs.
Advanced Parameters (Part 2)
Stylize: The stylize command (--s or --stylize) controls the amount of liberal style the algorithm applies. A lower value (e.g., 625) leads to a more literal interpretation of the prompt, while a higher value (up to 60,000) allows Midjourney to create more abstract, stylized images.
Quality: The quality command (--q or --quality) defines the quality of the generated images. A higher value increases the quality, the time it takes to generate the image, and the cost. A lower value decreases the quality, generation time, and cost. The default value is 1, but you can adjust it to suit your needs (e.g., 0.5 for half the default quality, 2 for double the default quality).
These advanced parameters give you more control over the image generation process in Midjourney. You can adjust the level of stylization and quality to achieve the results you want, whether you're aiming for a more literal interpretation of your prompt or a more abstract, stylized image.
Emojis
Video Export: You can export a time-lapse video of your artwork being processed in Midjourney by adding the parameter --video at the end of your text prompt. Once the image processing is finished, you can request the video by reacting to the message with an envelope emoji. The video will show the step-by-step generation of the image.
Deleting Images: If you want to keep your work private, you can delete your image from Midjourney and the public galleries by reacting to the message with a red X emoji. This will remove the image so it's no longer publicly accessible. Remember to save your images first if you want to keep them.
Favoriting Images: You can mark images as favorites by reacting to the message with a star emoji. This will send the image to the favorites channel and show it in a separate feed on the web gallery.
These features give you more control over your artwork in Midjourney, allowing you to create time-lapse videos, delete images from public view, and mark your favorite images for easy access.
Using Emojis As Prompts
Emoji Artwork: In Midjourney, you can use emojis as prompts to generate artwork. For example, using a heart eyes emoji can generate an image of a woman looking lovingly at the viewer, while a dog emoji can generate a realistic image of a dog.
Combining Emojis: You can also combine emojis to create more complex prompts. For instance, combining a heart eyes emoji with a dog emoji can generate an image of a dog looking lovingly at its owner. Similarly, combining a lizard emoji with a bird emoji can generate an image that incorporates elements of both animals.
Modifying Existing Artwork: You can also use emojis to modify existing artwork. For example, adding a smiling emoji to a prompt can subtly change the expression of a character in the image, making them appear happier.
Experimentation: Using emojis in this way allows for a lot of experimentation and can help you create more nuanced and expressive images. It also provides a visual way to note and remember your prompts.
Using Commands Like A Pro
Commands in Midjourney: Commands are instructions you can type into the message box in Midjourney to control the application. You can access these commands by typing a forward slash (/).
Fast and Relax Modes: The "fast" command allows you to use the fast mode to create your images, while the "relax" command switches back to the slower mode.
Info and Help: The "info" command provides information about your profile, including your subscription, job mode, time left in fast mode, and number of images created. The "help" command provides useful information right inside the chat.
Settings: The "settings" command allows you to set some parameters without having to type them in each time. This includes choosing the algorithm, amount of stylization, quality, fast or relax mode, upscale light option, and public or private mode.
Preferred Suffix: The "preferred suffix" command allows you to input parameters that will be used every time you put in a prompt, so you don't have to repeat them. This is useful if you're working with a certain aspect ratio or want to use the algorithm in certain ways. To remove the preferred suffix, simply type "/preferred suffix" without entering anything after it.
Seeds
Seeds in Midjourney: Seeds are a powerful tool for maintaining consistency in your work in Midjourney. A seed number generates the random starting noise at the beginning of image generation. Using the same seed number across multiple prompts uses the same starting noise, leading to some consistency in image generation.
Using Seeds: To use a seed, find an image you like and want to recreate with some consistency. React to the image with an envelope emoji, which will generate four new messages of each individual image from a 2x2 grid, along with the seed number that it started with. You can then use this seed number in your next prompt by adding "-seed" and the number at the end of your prompt.
Same Seed: Another parameter you can use with seeds is "same seed". This keeps the same starting noise for all of the image generations inside of your work, leading to very similar interpretations of essentially the same crop using the same starting noise.
Aspect Ratio: Changing the aspect ratio, even when using the same seed, can completely change the content of the image.
Receiving Seed Number: To receive your seed number, you need to send the envelope emoji as a reaction to the prompt you are thinking of replicating.
Use of Seeds: Seeds are useful for refining your work when you find something you like and want to go deeper into it. They allow for consistency between different generations of images.
How to Get Realistic Faces
Using Faces in Midjourney: Creating realistic faces in Midjourney can be challenging, but there are a few tips and tricks to improve the authenticity and beauty of the faces generated.
Using Images: Adding an image as part of the prompt can help in generating more realistic faces. You can find an image, copy its URL, and paste it into your prompt.
Symmetrical Faces: Telling Midjourney to make the face symmetrical can also improve the realism of the generated faces. You can do this by adding "symmetrical face" to your prompt.
Stylization Value: Increasing the stylization value can also help in generating more realistic faces. You can do this by adding "-sw" and a higher value to your prompt.
Rerolling Prompts: If you're not happy with the faces generated, you can ask Midjourney to reroll the prompts. By continuously generating new versions, you can eventually get a realistic, attractive-looking face.
Using Photoshop: You can refine your image further by using tools like Warp and Bloat in Photoshop.
Upscaling Images: If you want to increase the resolution of your artwork, you can use an AI tool like Let's Enhance IO. This tool uses artificial intelligence to increase the size of your image without losing any detail. It can upscale your image by two, four, eight, or sixteen times.
Remember to reroll as much as possible, use the stylization parameter, use an image inside of the prompt, use the text prompt "symmetrical face", and use Let's Enhance IO to upscale and have larger resolution images.
Putting it All Together
Project Goal: The goal of this project is to create a collection of three neutral prints that would perform well on Etsy, fitting well with modern interior design.
Inspiration: Use Unsplash to search for neutral images and color themes. Open the images in new tabs and save the ones you like.
Replicate Tool: Use the Replicate tool to generate a prompt based on an image you like. It will provide useful keywords that can be used in your prompt.
Creating Prompts: Use the keywords from Replicate, add your own, and adjust the aspect ratio and image weight. Run the prompt in Midgard and adjust as necessary to get closer to your desired result.
Finalizing Images: Once you have images you like, save them and upscale them using Let's Enhance IO for the best resolution and quality.
Arranging Images: Use Figma to arrange and crop your images. You can rotate and flip the images to get the lines and composition you want.
Mock Up: Use a stock image to create a mock-up of your prints. This allows you to see how they would look in a real-world setting.
Iteration: The process involves a lot of iteration, from the initial image generation to the final arrangement of the prints. This allows you to refine your work and get closer to your vision.
Adding text to your work
In this lesson, we learned how to add text to your artwork using Figma, a free online design software. This is a great way to make your artwork stand out, as AI art generators currently struggle with creating good text. Here's a summary of the steps:
Choose a graphic image: Choose an image that would work well with text. The tutorial uses images with a Japanese theme as examples.
Import your image to Figma: Drag and drop your image into Figma.
Add text: Use the text tool in Figma to add text to your image. You can adjust the font, font style, size, alignment, letter spacing, and color to fit your image.
Choose a font: Use a free font website like 1001 fonts to find a font that fits your theme. Make sure to respect the intellectual property rights of the font designer.
Install the font: Download and install the font on your computer. You will also need to install the Figma font helper to use the font in Figma.
Adjust the text: Play around with the parameters of the text to make it fit well with your image. Consider the context of the image and what type of text might enhance the image.
Create a theme: If you have a collection of diverse artworks, you can create a coherent feel by using the same style of typography.
Export your image: Once you're happy with your image, you can export it from Figma.
This process can be used to create a variety of themed artworks, such as travel posters or movie posters. It's a great way to add a unique touch to your AI-generated art.

Midjourney Rules and Ethics
In this lesson, we're going to review some of the guidelines within Mid Journey to ensure you stay within the platform's rules and avoid any potential issues.
Mid Journey has a guidebook that outlines what is acceptable and what is not. One of the most important things to remember is that Mid Journey is a PG-13 platform, meaning that adult content or gore is not allowed.
Gore is defined as detached body parts of humans or animals, cannibalism, blood violence, deformed bodies, severed limbs, and pestilence. Adult content includes nudity, sexual organs, fixation on naked breasts, people in showers or on toilets, sexual imagery, and fetishes.
Offensive content, such as anything that can be deemed as racist, homophobic, disturbing, or derogatory to a community, is also not allowed. Mid Journey has implemented an automatic ban on certain keywords that could generate this type of content. If you try to use these keywords, your prompt will be invalidated and the request will be cancelled.
It's crucial to be aware of these guidelines to avoid getting banned from Mid Journey. However, this also raises an important ethical question. While Mid Journey does not allow certain types of content, other platforms might. This could potentially lead to the creation of ethically challenging artworks. This raises the question of whether these tools should be regulated to prevent the generation of harmful material.
In summary, this lesson has covered the basics of how to stay within the guidelines of Mid Journey. It's important to respect these rules to ensure a positive and respectful environment for all users.
Let's Enhance
In this lesson, we're going to explore how to upscale our images to the highest resolution possible. For this, we'll be using an artificial intelligence tool called Let's Enhance, which allows us to significantly increase the resolution of our images. This makes them more appealing and useful for potential customers.
First, navigate to letsenhance.io. You'll receive a few free credits to try out the service, and after that, you'll need to purchase additional credits.
To begin, go to your folder of downloaded images. Select all the images from your collection and drag them into the box at the top of the Let's Enhance page. You can choose how much you want to upscale your images. By default, they will be upscaled twice, doubling their size, which is usually sufficient.
Start the upscaling process by clicking 'Start Processing'. You'll know the images are finished processing when the full-resolution image is visible in the thumbnail. Once processing is complete, click on each image to download them.
After downloading your images and placing them in a folder, give them appropriate names. This adds a level of professionalism to your work. I suggest coming up with a brand name for your collection of images. It should be something short and unique for easy identification. If you can create a play on words that represents what's included in the images, that can be very effective.
For all of my packs, I use single-syllable, four-letter words that aren't real. For this pack, I'm going to call it 'Lilbu'. The idea behind this is that it's a light, rounded, curvaceous pack. 'Lilbu' is derived a bit from the word 'Malibu', which conjures up images of tropical parties, similar to the vibe of the pack I'm creating.
Once you've named your pack and created your brand, you'll have a collection of images ready for creating marketing materials. Thanks for watching, and see you in the next lesson.
What You Need to Know About Copyright
In this lesson, we're going to discuss copyright and your AI-generated art. With AI and artificially generated art, copyright becomes a complex issue. Who owns the images? Is it Midjourney, the algorithm, or you?
According to Midjourney's terms of service, by using the platform, you grant Midjourney, its successors, and assigns a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, sublicensable, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute text and image prompts that you input into the services, or assets produced by the service at your direction. This license survives termination of this agreement by any party for any reason.
My understanding of this is that Midjourney can do whatever it likes with anything you create inside of Midjourney. It's important to be aware of this. However, I am not a legal advisor, and this is just my interpretation of what it says on their website.
Midjourney's terms also state that, subject to the above license, you own all assets that you create with the services. This does not apply if you fall under certain exceptions. This means that you do own everything that you create in Midjourney and you are allowed to use them commercially and sell them for profit.
There are a couple of caveats to this. If you're not a paid member, you don't get these rights. And if you're a corporation using Midjourney but haven't bought the appropriate plan, you also don't get the rights outlined.
It's also important to consider whether you are creating a piece of AI art that is too similar to an existing piece of copyrighted work. If you are trying to recreate something that already exists, you could potentially get into trouble with the person who owns the original copyright.
Another thing to bear in mind is to be careful about using images as prompts that you don't have the rights to. But beyond these considerations, you're allowed to do what you like, and you can even make money selling your AI art.
So to summarize, my understanding is that Midjourney can take your work and do whatever it likes with it. You own all of the assets that you create and can do whatever you like with them commercially. However, you should avoid infringing on other people's existing copyright, and be aware that people can find, use, and copy your work from within the Midjourney public gallery. Thanks for watching, and see you in the next lesson.
