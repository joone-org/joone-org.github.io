Overview: Hi, my name is Chloe. I was raised in Scotland to a Scottish mother and a Chinese father. I'm bilingual, fluent in both English and Mandarin. Growing up, my parents instilled in me a strong work ethic and a love of learning, which led me to excel in academics and extracurricular activities.

Outside of school, I enjoy playing sports and practicing martial arts, which I learned from my father. I also like to read and write poetry, and have a passion for music. I play the violin and enjoy singing in my spare time.

One thing that's important to me is my family. I'm close with my parents and my younger sister, and we often spend time together cooking traditional meals and celebrating our culture. Overall, I would describe myself as hardworking, creative, and family-oriented.
