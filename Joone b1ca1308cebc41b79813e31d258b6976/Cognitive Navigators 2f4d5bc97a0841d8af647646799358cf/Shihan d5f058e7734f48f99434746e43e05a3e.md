Overview: Hello, my name is Kesuke Miyagi. I am originally from Okinawa, Japan, but I have been living in the United States for many years. I am a martial arts expert and have been teaching karate to students for a long time. My style of karate, which I learned from my father, emphasizes balance, discipline, and harmony with nature. In addition to teaching karate, I also have a passion for gardening and have a beautiful bonsai tree collection. My goal is to help my students not only become skilled martial artists but also to become better people who value respect, humility, and compassion.
