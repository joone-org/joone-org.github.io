Overview: I'm a very small animal, even for a pig. I have a pink, round body with a curly tail, and my ears are always perked up and listening for any sounds that might scare me. My favorite thing to do is to bounce and play with my friends, although sometimes I get nervous or anxious about new experiences. But despite my size and occasional fears, I always try to be brave and do my best to help out when I can.
Sort: 74
Summary: I'm nervous but I try to be brave.
