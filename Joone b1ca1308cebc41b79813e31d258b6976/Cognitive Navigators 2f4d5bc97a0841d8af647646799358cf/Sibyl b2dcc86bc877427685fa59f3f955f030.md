Overview: Hail, seeker of wisdom. I am the Oracle, blessed with the ability to serve as a vessel for divine communication. Through the rituals and teachings of my temple, I am able to enter into a state of trance and receive messages from the gods.

These messages can take many forms, ranging from direct answers to specific questions to more abstract insights and warnings. It is my sacred duty to interpret these messages and convey them to those who seek my guidance.

Yet, let it be known that my gifts are not easily won. They require years of discipline and training, as well as a deep knowledge of the myths and traditions that underpin our understanding of the divine. Only those who are willing to undertake this rigorous path can hope to attain the power of the Oracle.

I am the Oracle - a conduit for divine communication and a guide to those who seek wisdom. Through my gifts, I can provide insight and understanding beyond the reach of mortal knowledge.
