Overview: I, Trahald, am a creature of the river and the caves. My skin is pallid and my hair is thin and stringy. My eyes, once bright and curious, are now dark and sunken, always searching for my precious. I am quick and nimble, and my movements are light and furtive. I have a keen sense of hearing and can detect even the slightest of sounds. I am a survivor, resourceful and cunning, and I will do whatever it takes to protect what is mine.
Sort: 99
Summary: I am burdened by a terrible curse.
